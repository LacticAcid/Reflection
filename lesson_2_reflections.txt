What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 Maybe the staging area and working directory is the part of repostory.
 And I think the staging area is store something you operate but not store into your file completely like a buffer area.
 And the working directory is save something you can see in your system explorer.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

 Run git diff --staged to compare staging area to repostory,make sure that is what you have change to save,then run git commit to add the commit message to submit the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

 We can use the graph of the branch,to see the branch relationship clearly.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

 Merge two branch will merge the changing of two branch which from their common parent.
 The git log --graph show it there are two path on the old version file,and it is sort of time to show.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

 Maybe the merging automatically is very convenient for us,but there if exist a changing of same area will make a conflict,also we can fix it easily because Git has sign the conflict in the file.
